            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

Yet <hi>Restalriges</hi> own Resignation or Disposition bears no such thing, But expresly bears to the Queen her Heirs and Assigneys. <hi>2dly.</hi> The Contract is <hi>Contractis Conditionalli,</hi> either to Erect or Repay the Moneys. <hi>3dly.</hi> The Contract could not bind the Queen being Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor; But the Law allows all Minors to Revoke, as well Princes as others, and she did Revoke, and thereafterwards disponed the Superiority to <hi>Edinburgh, Anno</hi> 1565. <hi>4ly.</hi> Before the said Contract, the Laird of <hi>Restalrige</hi> had renounced in Favours of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> all Girnelling of Cornes, selling of Wines, <hi>&amp;c:</hi> in <hi>Anno</hi> 1398, Ratified by King <hi>James</hi> 4th, <hi>Anno</hi> 1510. <hi>5thly.</hi> They have enjoyed the Superiority about 40 years, which cannot now be called in Question, after so long time as is statute by express Act of Parliament.</p>

                  <p>TO their Answers, <hi>Leith</hi> made thir Replys, Which Collonel <hi>Bryan</hi> omits in his Report, and therefore would be considered. To the <hi>1st.</hi> Seeing the Eminent place wherein GOD hath placed Princes and Soveraign Rulers, doth Liberate them from the common Course of Law, and personal Execution against them, by Hornings, Inhibitions, such Legal Diligences as are not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed to other Subjects, against any fellow Subjects. Therefore it is, that even in Law, a Princess Personal Contract or Stipulation is esteemed as ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieging for Security to the Partie with whom the Stipulation or Contract is made, as if it were Real, and had all the other Formalities requisit in Contract between Subjects: And therefore, albeit <hi>Restalrigs</hi> Renounciation bears not, That he did the same, to the Effect <hi>Leith</hi> might be Erected. Yet seeing the Queen Dowagers Contract, which is of the same day the said Renounciation, and before the same Witnesses, bears expresly, and that <hi>Restalrige</hi>'s receiving the 3000 pound from <hi>Leith,</hi> is the price of the said Resignation imports no less, These are equivolent as to <hi>Restalrigs</hi> own Renounciation had carryed in Favours of <hi>Leith.</hi> To the 2<hi>d.</hi> Albeit it had been conditional to pay the Money, and the Q: might have made her Election; Yet seeing the Money was never payed, the Erection is now the Alternative, only prestable, and she could never have deprived them of the only disposing <hi>Leith</hi>'s Superiority, unless he had first performed the other Alternative Condition. To the 3<hi>d.</hi> The Queens Major (as is clear by her Revocation in Parliament,) the time of the said Contract, and Gift of <hi>Baylirie,</hi> which was Nine Moneths after her Revocation, in <hi>Anno</hi> 1555: The year beginning in <hi>March</hi> as it yet doth in <hi>England,</hi> and continued so till the year 1600: Neither could she ever have Revocked the Acts done in Favours of <hi>Leith,</hi> seeing her publick Revenue much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">

To the <hi>4th.</hi> These Particulars renounced, being personal Slaveries, or inconsistent with the common Liberty of a People, and are taken away by the Act of Union, And albeit they could be estimate <hi>praedial</hi> Servitudes, such as may be imposed, and due from one Village to another. yet they could not now be claimed by <hi>Edinburgh</hi> from <hi>Leith,</hi> because such Servitudes <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">

To the second Answer being, that the Bailery was personal <hi>quoad</hi> the Queen, and died with her, because it wanted infeftment. It is Reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; Yet the assertion is assured a Bailery, being but a bare Office may very well be transmitted without any Infeftment; And is sufficiently sufficient by Gift under the Great Seal, and is nottour in all the Offices of <hi>Scotland,</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially this being a Bailery given to an Incorporation which cannot dy.
